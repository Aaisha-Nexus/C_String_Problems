# C++ String Practice Problems

This repository contains a collection of C++ programs designed to tackle various string manipulation challenges. The programs use a combination of algorithms, including recursion, to solve problems involving substrings, character manipulation, and other string operations.

## Programs Included

### 1. Count_Hi.cpp
Counts the number of occurrences of the substring "hi" in a given string.

### 2. Count_Vowel.cpp
Counts the number of vowels in a given string.

### 3. IsAnagram_Checker.cpp
Checks if two given strings are anagrams of each other.

### 4. IsPangram_Checker.cpp
Checks if a given string is a pangram (contains every letter of the alphabet at least once).

### 5. Length_of_String_usingPointers.cpp
Calculates the length of a string using pointers.

### 6. Lexicographical_order.cpp
Sorts a list of strings in lexicographical order.

### 7. Remove_X.cpp
Removes all occurrences of the character 'x' from a given string.

### 8. Remove_leading0.cpp
Removes leading zeros from a given string representing a number.

### 9. Replace_XY.cpp
Replaces all occurrences of the substring "xy" with another string in the given string.

### 10. Replace_pi.cpp
Replaces all occurrences of the substring "pi" with "3.14" in a given string.

### 11. Reverse_String_PalindromeCheck.cpp
Reverses a given string and checks if it is a palindrome.

### 12. Sandwich_String.cpp
Extracts and prints the substring between two specified characters in a given string.

### 13. move_all_x.cpp
Moves all occurrences of the character 'x' to the end of the string.

## Key Features

- **Recursion**: Many programs in this repository utilize recursion to simplify and solve complex string manipulation problems.
- **Substrings and Characters**: The programs cover a variety of string operations, including substring extraction, character replacement, and more.
